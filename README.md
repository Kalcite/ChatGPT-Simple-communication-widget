A small program written in Python that is convenient for calling Api of OpenAI to talk  
  Because I am using the python development environment of Windows 10,The operating system is lower than Windows10 and may not run programs. I'm trying to make windows7 support my program  
  Support the operation of the operating system compatible with the development environment of windows 10 (python 3.10) and above  
I'm trying to find a new model because the model database version of DaVinci-3 is too old(Even in 2020)  
## All APIs have usage restrictions, not completely free! Please pay attention to your use. Don't give the Key to others at will! This program will not collect any of your private information!Please refer to the official document for details.[How do I view my usage?](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage)  
You can try not to use the most powerful model to save costs (the price of davanci-3 model is 1000 tokens=$0.02)  
Some models that are not particularly powerful, such as  
Curie's price is $0.0020/1K tokens  
Babbage price is $0.0005/1K tokens  
These models have their own advantages. Please refer to the official documents above for details (there are options in the program)  
### [About Model Selection](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)  
### Prepare to build a special tool for writing code based on [CodeX] : )  
### [Check the number of your tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)Is it really necessary to do this? Of course, but only when your balance is short : )
